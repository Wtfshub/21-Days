      <h1>21 Days Together</h1>
      <p class="message">
        In just 21 days, you’ve turned ordinary moments into unforgettable
        memories. Every smile, every laugh, and every shared glance has been a
        reminder of just how special you are to me. It feels like I’ve known you
        forever, yet each day still brings new surprises and deeper connections.
        Thank you for filling my world with warmth and happiness. I can’t wait
        to see where this journey takes us, hand in hand, heart to heart. Here’s
        to the magic we’ve created in these first 21 days and to the countless
        days ahead of us. With all my love
      </p>
